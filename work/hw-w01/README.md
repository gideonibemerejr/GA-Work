# GA SEI Homework Area

---

### Introduction

I've created this directory to make uploading homework easier to do and easier to find.  Each week's deliverables will be uploaded here __unless otherwise instructed__.

### Documentation (How you can do it too)
#### macOS Setup
1. Make sure you have homebrew __and__ tree installed by running the following in your terminal: 
    ```
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```
2. Once hombrew is installed run:
    ```
    brew install tree
    ```
3. cd into your SEI-CC-22 directory, cd into the work directory and run:
   ```
   tree
   ```
4. You should see something similar to this:
    ```
    /work
      /w01
          /d1
            /01-topic
            /02-topic
            /03-topic
            /04-topic
            /05-topic
            /hw-topic
    ```
